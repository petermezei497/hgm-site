When we speak about the state, most of us imagine something distant and impersonal.
Laws, offices, regulations — systems that seem to hover above our lives,
something we merely react to or try to comply with.
Yet the state was not originally a structure of power.
It was the living fabric of a community.
The way people organised life together
so that no one was left alone,
and children could grow up in safety.

that cannot be taken — only given.”
Most economic systems are built on scarcity.
Scarcity of time, resources, money, attention —
and competition follows naturally from this.
If someone wins,
someone else must lose.
This logic is deeply embedded in how we operate.
Yet there is something that is not scarce.
Trust.
It cannot be owned.
It cannot be regulated.
It cannot be forced.
And yet it is the foundation of every human and economic relationship.

In today’s world, the word value is almost automatically
associated with money or profit.
As if that were the only measure:
how much it brings in,
what it costs,
what it’s worth.
Yet real value is not what we possess —
but what we create with responsibility.
The question is not how much we have accumulated,
but what we have added to the world.

but because it has been disconnected from joy.”
For most people, work is something
to get through.
Tasks.
Deadlines.
Obligations.
Expectations.
As if work were a necessary evil —
something to endure
so that life can begin afterwards.
But work did not originate this way.
Not as coercion.
Not as survival mode.
But as creation.
Once upon a time, work meant
taking part in shaping the world.
Contributing.
Seeing the meaning in what one does.

For a long time, the world’s economies were built on
money, resources, and time.
But in the 21st century, something has shifted.
The most valuable thing is no longer what you have —
but what you give your attention to.
Attention has become the new currency.
The scarcest resource of all —
and yet the only one each person truly owns.
Companies, media, and political systems all compete
to capture it, steer it, or fragment it.
...</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span>2 min</span></footer></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2><a href=/en/lessons/2025-11-13-value-without-ownership/>Value without ownership</a></h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>“What you cling to dissolves.
What you share expands.”
The world many of us grew up in taught us
that what we own is what defines us.
Ownership became the foundation of
security, status, and identity.
And yet, as awareness slowly widens,
another truth begins to surface:
the most meaningful forms of value
are not the ones we hold onto,
but the ones we allow to flow.
Love.
Attention.
Knowledge.

For a long time, the modern world believed that progress was driven by
money, technology, or productivity.
But if we look more closely,
everything rests on one thing:
connection.
Connection between people.
Connection between a person and their work.
Connection between a person and the world.
Every form of value,
every piece of knowledge,
every real innovation
is born from connection.

It simply opens.”
The world we grew up in taught us
that life is competition.
That if someone wins,
someone else must lose.
That humans are selfish by nature,
and only external rules keep us in check.
But this is not true.
A child does not want to be better than others —
they want to connect.
To play.
To share.
To wonder.
Nature does not compete either.

when it is not born of pressure,
but when space opens through it.”
In most systems, responsibility feels heavy.
Something you have to take on.
Something strict.
Something that weighs on you.
Something you are held accountable for.
This kind of responsibility is usually born from fear.
Fear of making mistakes.
Fear of consequences.
Fear rooted in a lack of trust.
But when trust is present,
when there is space,
when a system has a human tone,

The future is you.”
Most people believe
that the problems of the world must be solved from the top down.
Through laws.
Through institutions.
Through large, system-level decisions.
As if our lives were shaped by distant forces,
and we were merely carried along by them.
Yet every real change
always begins within.
In a faint realisation.
In a subtle inner tension: “this isn’t quite right.”
In an unexpected insight that stops us for a moment.
In a new way of tuning into the world.
