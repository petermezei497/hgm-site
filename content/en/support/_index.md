Human Growth Model is not a product, not a service, and not a subscription.  
It's a growing collection of notes, experiments, and frameworks about **being mentally well first** — and **building from there**.

If something here resonates, helps you think more clearly, or simply feels right, you're welcome to support its continuation.

No subscriptions. No obligations. No expectations.

Clean. Simple. Free.
