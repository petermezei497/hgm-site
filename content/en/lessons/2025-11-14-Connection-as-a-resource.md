title: Connection as a resource

“Connection is not a luxury — it is infrastructure.”

For a long time, the modern world believed that progress was driven by  
money, technology, or productivity.

But if we look more closely,  
everything rests on one thing:

**connection**.

Connection between people.  
Connection between a person and their work.  
Connection between a person and the world.

Every form of value,  
every piece of knowledge,  
every real innovation  
is born from connection.

Not from rules.  
Not from control.  
Not from competition.

Connection is where information flows.  
Where trust is formed.  
Where creativity is released.

Connection itself is **infrastructure**.

Not a luxury.  
Not an extra.  
Not something we add “if there’s time”.

As fundamental as water, electricity, or the internet.

When connections weaken,  
systems begin to collapse.

When connections strengthen,  
systems grow.

This is why the logic of Collective Capitalism —  
and what later became the Human Growth Model —  
is simple:

What connects, creates value.  
What separates, creates loss.

Loneliness is not only an emotional condition —  
it is an economic one.

An isolated person is less creative,  
offers less energy,  
and receives less in return.

But when two people truly connect…

When they listen to one another.  
When they think together.  
When they attune to each other —

the system multiplies itself.

One person’s energy becomes three.  
One idea becomes a network.  
One moment becomes a resource.

I’ve experienced this many times.

Any interaction where openness and friendliness are present  
leaves us more than we were before.  
The longer the positive interaction lasts,  
the deeper the recharge.

Sometimes it’s as simple as a small moment:  
earlier today, a young boy waved at me in traffic.  
I loved it.

Other times, it’s deeper and longer.

I’m thinking of a birthday gathering  
where I spoke openly with everyone —  
almost at a childlike level.

We weren’t debating opinions.  
We were exploring ourselves together.  
Learning through conversation.

I spent hours there.  
Then drove home for over an hour.

Yet I stayed alert.  
Light.  
In a genuinely good mood.

What stayed with me  
was how deeply nourishing that connection had been.

This is the essence of connection.

The child waving in traffic — a brief flash of pure humanity.  
The open conversations — a space where people truly meet.

Many would call these moments “just nice gestures”.

In reality, they are what **holds the world together**.

Connection is not complicated.  
Not intellectual.  
Not strategic.

Connection is **energy exchange**.

And when it is open and mutual,  
that energy doesn’t just circulate —  
it multiplies.

This is where the philosophy of Collective Capitalism  
and the Human Growth Model becomes lived reality:

Connection is not merely an emotion.

It is a **resource**.

And through positive connection,  
we don’t just become more.

We become **more fully ourselves**.
