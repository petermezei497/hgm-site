“Work is not hard because it is work —  
but because it has been disconnected from joy.”

For most people, work is something  
to *get through*.

Tasks.  
Deadlines.  
Obligations.  
Expectations.

As if work were a necessary evil —  
something to endure  
so that life can begin *afterwards*.

But work did not originate this way.

Not as coercion.  
Not as survival mode.  
But as **creation**.

Once upon a time, work meant  
taking part in shaping the world.  
Contributing.  
Seeing the meaning in what one does.

Joy was not a reward.  
It was a natural side effect.

The disconnection began  
when work lost touch with its impact.

When people could no longer see  
who they were helping,  
what they were building,  
what they were contributing to.

When the purpose of work  
shifted from creation  
to output.

In the perspective of the Human Growth Model,  
joy is not a luxury.  
Not a motivational tool.  
Not an “extra”.

Joy is **feedback**.

It signals that a person is in alignment  
with what they are doing.

It does not mean  
there is no fatigue.  
No difficulty.  
No responsibility.

It means that the energy invested  
does not leak away meaninglessly.

There was a time when I also believed  
that work was only serious  
if it was heavy.

If it was strenuous.  
If it was tense.

And when joy appeared,  
I became suspicious —  
as if something must be wrong.

But that was precisely when it was right.

Joy is not the opposite of performance.  
It is **the sign that performance is not born of fear**.

When someone enjoys what they do,  
they do not work less.

They are *present* in it.

They pay attention.  
They connect.  
They take responsibility.

And paradoxically,  
this is when the most value is created.

The work of the future will not be easier.  
But it will be **more alive**.

It will not require less effort,  
but less self-denial.

Change begins  
when we allow ourselves the question:

What if work did not drain life —  
but were **part of it**?

Not as a reward.  
Not as an exception.

But as a natural state. ❤️
