“The state does not exist above us, but between us.”

When we speak about *the state*, most of us imagine something distant and impersonal.  
Laws, offices, regulations — systems that seem to hover above our lives,  
something we merely react to or try to comply with.

Yet the state was not originally a structure of power.

It was the **living fabric of a community**.  
The way people organised life together  
so that no one was left alone,  
and children could grow up in safety.

The rupture appeared when this fabric slowly became **detached from the human being**.

Today, the state often behaves like a machine:  
it exercises power, but does not connect.  
It regulates, but does not hold.  
It governs, but does not feel.

And yet, another reading is possible.

The state is not a governing tower,  
but a **supportive network**.  
It does not dominate — it connects.  
It does not control — it nourishes.

The state works well  
when it is **human**.

In this view, trust is not an end goal,  
but a **starting point**.  
When people feel that the system is with them — not against them —  
the meaning of law itself begins to shift:  
it no longer feels like a constraint,  
but like a sense of safety.

And this is where something deeper happens.

When the fear of basic insecurity dissolves,  
when constant self-protection is no longer required,  
the energy we currently spend on survival  
is released for **creation**.

This is not a political reform.  
It is a **shift in vibration**.

When people no longer work *against* scarcity,  
but *towards* joy,  
collective functioning moves to a new level.

The systems we live in today were also created by people —  
at the level of awareness available at the time,  
with what they believed to be good intentions.

But we are no longer there.

We have begun to recognise that money is not everything.  
That control is not the strongest force.  
That safety does not make us complacent —  
it **liberates** us.

The state is always a mirror of human consciousness.  
When consciousness shifts,  
the system cannot remain unchanged.

The emerging state will not be stronger,  
but **higher in resonance**:  
it will regulate less, but understand more;  
own less, but hold more.

And change begins  
the moment we dare to say:

**The state does not serve us.  
We are the state.**
