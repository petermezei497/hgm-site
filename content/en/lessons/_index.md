These are not lessons.

They are core ideas —
points of perspective through which the Human Growth Model takes shape.

What began as a re-examination of economics
gradually revealed deeper layers:
human connection, attention, responsibility,
and ultimately the realisation that systems begin within us.

These texts are not final answers.
They are prompts.
A work in progress —
traces of a living thought process.

They are not frameworks to follow,
but shared observations.

If you read them all,
you won’t “learn” the HGM —
you’ll start to understand why it is different.

If these writings spark questions in you,  
they have already done their job. ❤️
