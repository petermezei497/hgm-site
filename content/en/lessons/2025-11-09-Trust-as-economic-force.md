title: Trust as an economic force

“Trust is the only currency  
that cannot be taken — only given.”

Most economic systems are built on **scarcity**.  
Scarcity of time, resources, money, attention —  
and competition follows naturally from this.

If someone wins,  
someone else must lose.

This logic is deeply embedded in how we operate.  
Yet there is something that is **not scarce**.

Trust.

It cannot be owned.  
It cannot be regulated.  
It cannot be forced.

And yet it is **the foundation of every human and economic relationship**.

Trust is the invisible currency  
that **comes before money**.  
Without trust, money itself loses its meaning.

Every contract, every market, every institution  
is built on an **advance of trust** —  
on the assumption that the other party will not abuse it.

When genuine trust is present,  
systems begin to **self-organise**.

Fewer rules are needed.  
Less control.  
Less monitoring.

Not because people are “better”,  
but because they **naturally take responsibility**.

Trust is not naïve.  
It is not weakness.

It is **economic force**.

Because it releases the energy  
that fear constantly freezes.

I experienced this very clearly once.

I was working as a mid-level leader in a global company  
when a new bonus system was introduced.  
I believed I had been given more responsibility.  
I felt that **I was trusted**.

That feeling generated energy almost immediately.  
Enthusiasm.  
Ideas.  
Room to move.

Later, it became clear that I only had the right to make recommendations —  
not actual decision-making authority.

I had built the rollercoaster myself —  
but the difference was still crystal clear.

In the **moment of trust**,  
motivation took flight.

Not because of the money.  
Not because of the bonus.

But because I believed  
**my decisions mattered**.

And this is what most systems lose.

Not their resources —  
but people’s **voluntarily offered energy**.

In the world of Collective Capitalism — *which, over time, has become one layer of the Human Growth Model (HGM) for me* — trust is not a secondary value.

It is the **most important measurable resource**.

Where trust exists,  
innovation,  
collective energy,  
and human wellbeing  
reinforce one another.

Fear was the driving force of the old world.

Trust is the language of another.

The new economy begins  
where trust is no longer a risk,  
but the **default mode of operation**.
