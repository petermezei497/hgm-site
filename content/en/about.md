Hi, I’m Pete.

The Human Growth Model (HGM) isn’t self-help and it isn’t an ideology.
It’s a repeatable, human-centred way of thinking about one core question:
how we become mentally well — and then build from that state.

This space is a collection of notes, experiments, and emerging frameworks.
I often start from small, everyday moments (because that’s where reality leaks through),
then translate them into a systems view.

The goal isn’t optimisation or endurance.
It’s to create from inner stability.

Read, question, challenge, suggest topics —  
playful, but precise.  
That’s how the model stays alive. 🤓

We don’t need to be faster.  
Or harder.  
Just freer. ❤️
