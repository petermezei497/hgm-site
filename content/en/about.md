Hi, I'm Pete,

I write to think.
And I think to understand how systems affect people.

I’m interested in how work, structure, culture and everyday decisions
shape our nervous systems — often quietly, without us noticing.

I don’t offer ready-made answers.
I pay attention, connect patterns,
and share what becomes visible along the way.

Sometimes this turns into short journal-like pieces.
Sometimes into questions that don’t rush towards conclusions.

If something here resonates
and you’d like to talk, reflect, or simply say hello:

hello@human-growth-model.xyz


If you feel like supporting this work,
it’s genuinely appreciated. ❤️

We don’t need to be faster.
Or harder.
Just freer. ❤️
