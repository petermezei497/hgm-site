There’s a sentence that keeps coming back to me.

“**I’ll handle it on my own.**”

For a long time, I thought this was strength.
Independence.
Maturity.

Lately, I see it more as a *learned pattern*.

As if somewhere early on we absorbed the idea that
asking for help is awkward,
leaning on others is uncomfortable,
and a “proper” adult doesn’t bother people with their needs.

But there’s a quiet twist in this story.

The task doesn’t get smaller.
**The weight just stays entirely on us**.

And we don’t burn out because the work is too much,
but because we’re carrying it alone.

⸻

Interestingly, when we *do* allow ourselves to ask —
not perfectly,
not strategically,
just honestly saying:

“*this would be easier with a hand*” —

nothing dramatic usually happens.

The world doesn’t collapse.
No invisible debt is created.
We don’t become less.

If anything, **something softens**.

The situation may not shrink,
but it opens.
It stops being sealed off.
Lonely.
Tight.

As if help doesn’t take something away,
but **creates space**.

And as if collaboration doesn’t weaken us,
but quietly returns something
we lost along the way while saying
“*I’ll handle it.*”

⸻

Maybe the real question isn’t
whether we can do things on our own.

But **why we believe**
**that we always should**. ❤️
