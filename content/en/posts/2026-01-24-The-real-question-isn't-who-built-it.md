Discussions around the Great Pyramid of Khufu have never really been about who built it — at least not for me.

They’re far more interesting as a lens into what happens to a system when one of its core assumptions turns out to be wrong.

The real “risk” isn’t that new information emerges.
It’s that an axiom collapses.
An unspoken foundation on which explanations, narratives, and collective self-images have quietly rested.

That’s when a system’s flexibility is revealed.

A stable system doesn’t fall apart when it has to refine its own story.
It isn’t afraid to say: this is what we believed — now we know more.
People remain people.
Cultures don’t disappear.
The picture simply becomes more nuanced, more accurate.

Fragile systems, on the other hand, do fear this moment.
Because when an axiom breaks, it may turn out that not everything followed from what we thought it did.

In that sense, the later “after-builds” following the Great Pyramid are telling as well.
Not in terms of who was more skilled,
but in how rare truly enduring work is —
and how greatness cannot always be reproduced through intent or power alone.

Perhaps that’s why this topic still resonates today.
Not because of the past,
but because many of our present-day systems operate in exactly the same way:
they’re not afraid of the truth —
they’re afraid they wouldn’t withstand correction.
