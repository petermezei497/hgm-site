title: "Why do companies optimise for individuals rather than collective?"

Most companies are powered by the collective.
Yet they optimise individuals in isolation.

Performance is rarely created by one person.
It emerges from interaction, timing, trust, and shared context.

Yet most organisations focus on:
- boxed roles
- individual KPIs
- responsibility matrices
- optimisation in silos

Instead of optimising connection.

When the system doesn’t support natural collaboration, something predictable happens:
People get stuck.
They feel exposed.
They start scheduling meetings — not out of curiosity, but out of fear.

And here’s the paradox:
People do connect.
But because that connection is forced, not chosen,
it becomes energetically draining instead of generative.

Meetings become compensation for a system that doesn’t allow people to think together safely.

If connection were built into the system:
- there would be fewer meetings
- less ego-protection
- less over-documentation
- less performative coordination

Because collaboration wouldn’t be a crisis response.
It would be the default state.

The problem isn’t that people aren’t driven enough.
It’s that the cost of connecting is too high.

When that cost drops, performance stops being something you push for —
and starts becoming a side effect.

Not faster.
Not harder.
Just freer. ❤️
