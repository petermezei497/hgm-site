There are always people who do well even within a system that seems flawed.

Not because the system works well.
But because they know what truly matters.

What’s interesting is that these people are rarely happy in isolation.
They tend to thrive when they are present in their communities as well —
when they contribute, connect, and share real experiences.

The more living, genuine connections someone has around them,
the more stable and resilient the whole network becomes.

Perhaps what we need first is not new systems,
but to relearn how to hold one another —
across different levels, at the same time. ❤️
