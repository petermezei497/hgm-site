More and more, I see that the Human Growth Model
is not pushing against capitalism.

It’s a **natural consequence** of it.

Mental health entered the conversation back in the 1970s.
At first on an individual level —
mostly through symptoms: burnout, stress, breakdowns.

Later, it appeared on a social level:
charities, grassroots initiatives, support projects.
Important steps — but largely **symptom-focused**.

Then something else began to emerge: **awareness**.

First in individuals.
Then in communities.
And eventually in organizations.

Not as a branding exercise.
But because **it worked**.

Startups appeared with:
– fairer compensation models
– transparent operations
– real involvement

And those who experienced it carried it forward.
Not as ideology.
As **lived experience**.

More recently, elite athletes stepped away from global competitions
citing mental health.
Unthinkable a decade ago.
Today, it’s speakable.

Gen Z is even clearer:
they simply won’t work in exploitative systems.
They want meaningful work.
Fair pay.
Human treatment.

If it’s not there — they don’t go.

For a long time, the system shrugged.
Now it’s starting to **creak**.

Because an entire generation cannot simply be skipped —
especially in economies built on continuous participation.

Gen Alpha isn’t arguing either.
They’re developing a new language.
A different way of thinking.
A different way of relating.

And here I am, a xennial —
a hybrid of Gen X and Gen Y,
usually somewhere between two worlds.

Right now, I’m not standing between generations,
but between two systems,
trying to build a bridge.

For me, the Human Growth Model isn’t an ideology.

It’s the recognition that the current form of capitalism
is increasingly getting stuck —
as if it has outgrown itself.

What’s alive in it will remain.
What isn’t will fall away.

This isn’t a revolution.
It’s **maturation**.

And while it may feel slow,
it’s been unfolding for a long time already.

We don’t need to be faster.
Or harder.
Just **freer**. ❤️
