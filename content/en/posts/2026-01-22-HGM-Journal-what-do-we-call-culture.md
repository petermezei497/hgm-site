Today, a post crossed my feed  
on the Day of Hungarian Culture.

It was about  
*what culture means to me*.

Human experiences.  
Memories.  
National motifs.

And yet, something was missing.

---

As I started thinking about it,  
one thing became clear:

We often describe culture  
as an **internal experience**.

But most of the cultures  
we talk about in everyday life  
are not internal at all.

They are **ways of living together**.

---

Leadership culture.  
Workplace culture.  
Traffic culture.  
Smoking culture.

They all share one common ground.

Not  
*what I feel*.

But  
**whether I take others into account**.

---

Culture begins  
the moment I realise  
that I am not alone in a space.

That what I do  
has an impact on others.

Not out of morality.  
Not because of rules.  
But because this is how systems work.

---

National culture is only one layer.

If this human foundation is missing underneath,  
it easily turns into:

– nostalgia  
– identity defence  
– or branding

But not a living culture.

---

From an HGM perspective,  
I would phrase it like this:

*Culture is not what we preserve.*  
*It is how we make space livable for one another.*

---

I didn’t want to argue with the post.

Only to notice a blind spot.

Because when we talk about culture  
and **the other person is absent from it**,  
something essential is missing.

And perhaps this is exactly  
what is worth bringing back  
into the conversation, again and again. ❤️
