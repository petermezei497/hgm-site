There is another layer<br>
we rarely articulate<br>
when we talk about culture.

Yet so much depends on it.

---

For me, culture<br>
is not only tradition,<br>
not only language,<br>
not only memory.

It is **space**.

A space<br>
we use together.

---

Culture becomes alive<br>
not when *I* am free,<br>
but when **you can be free next to me**.

When you don’t have to shrink yourself.<br>
When you don’t have to adapt<br>
so that I can comfortably fit.

---

Openness belongs here too.

Knowing other languages.<br>
Respecting other cultures.<br>
Accepting that<br>
not everything is about me.

Not surrender.<br>
Not self-erasure.

**Creating space.**

---

Perhaps that’s why it feels to me<br>
that beneath culture<br>
there are no rules,<br>
but a quiet agreement:

“You may be free.<br>
And I will not take that freedom away from you.”

---

This is a kind of<br>
good-natured “herd instinct”.

Not assimilation.<br>
Not sameness.

But the joy of moving together.<br>
Of living freely \*\*not against each other,<br>
but alongside one another\*\*.

---

From this perspective,<br>
culture is not something<br>
that needs to be defended.

It is something<br>
that must be **practised**.

Every day.<br>
In small decisions.<br>
In ordinary situations.

---

Perhaps this is the level<br>
where culture is<br>
no longer an identity debate,<br>
no longer a flag,<br>
no longer a label.

But shared freedom. ❤️
