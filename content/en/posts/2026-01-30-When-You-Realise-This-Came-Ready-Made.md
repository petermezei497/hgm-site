There's a recurring insight I keep returning to.

We often hear that people who grow up in dysfunctional environments replicate those patterns in adulthood — not because they want to, but because it's familiar. It became their "normal."

There's truth in this. But it's incomplete.


Repetition is one path to recognition. But not the only one.
The same realisation can arrive through:
- Physical movement
- Stillness and silence
- Slowing down
- Cognitive reframing

The route doesn't matter.

What matters is the moment this sentence forms:

"I received this ready-made. This was the norm.
But I'm an adult now. I'm empowered to rethink the values.”

This recognition doesn't resolve everything.

It doesn't erase emotions.
It doesn't bring static equilibrium.
It brings direction.

Because equilibrium isn't a state — it's a pursuit.

We approach it. We drift. We recalibrate. We approach again.


This pattern applies beyond individuals.

Societal norms shift continuously.

What the 1960s deemed "natural," we now rightly recognise as segregating and harmful. That shift brought correction.

But not all change is corrective.

Today, it feels as though core values themselves are drifting — not just norms.

And that's not correction. That's loss of direction.


When this happens:
- Compassion becomes conditional
- Truth becomes narrative-dependent
- Accountability gets replaced by storytelling

There's nothing stable left to converge towards.

Yet equilibrium requires fixed reference points.

This is true for individuals.
And it's true for communities.


I always arrive at this insight through thinking — not by suppressing emotion, but by reaching the point where I can name what's happening.

It's not our emotions that control us most powerfully.
It's what we believed was "normal" for far too long.

When that becomes questionable, real room to manoeuvre begins. ❤️
