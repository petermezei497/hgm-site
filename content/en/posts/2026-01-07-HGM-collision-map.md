It doesn’t happen overnight.  
It starts with small frictions.

With thoughts that feel familiar:

- *“Why am I tired when, on paper, everything is fine?”*
- *“Why is it hard to ask for help, even when there is someone to ask?”*
- *“When did work turn into survival?”*
- *“Why do I constantly feel like I have to prove myself?”*

These are **not personal failures**.  
They are **collisions**.

A collision between **an old system of functioning**  
and **the human nervous system**.

Where the system says:  
**perform → prove → hold your role**

And the body answers:  
**tension → defense → exhaustion**

---

There is a point where these collisions are no longer loud.  
Not dramatic.

Just **constant**.

This is where things start to appear that feel *“off”*:

- procrastination around things that matter
- cynicism where there used to be enthusiasm
- loneliness, even when surrounded by people
- irritation over small things

This is usually where people blame themselves.

But the problem isn’t **the person**.  
It’s **the framework** they are trying to function in.

---

**HGM doesn’t start with “doing better.”**  
It starts with **noticing the collision**.

Moments like:

- when time disappears during a shared activity
- when, in a conversation, you no longer need to hold a role
- when a project isn’t easier — just *more livable*
- when work moves forward *without pressure*

And only afterwards you realize:

*“Wait… there was no fear here.”*

---

That’s the essence of **the collision map**.

Not telling you what you *should* do.  
But showing where it **hurts** —  
and where it **doesn’t**.

Where there is no constant self-defense,  
**playfulness appears**.

Where there is no hidden accounting,  
**help becomes natural**.

Where there is **safety**,  
less doesn’t happen —  
**more does**.

---

**HGM doesn’t replace the old system.**  
It simply makes visible  
where it collides with *being human*.

And once you see it,  
**you can’t unsee it.**

We don’t need to be faster.  
We need to be **freer**. ❤️
