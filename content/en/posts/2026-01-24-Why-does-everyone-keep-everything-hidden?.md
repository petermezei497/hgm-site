If everything is working properly,
why has secrecy become the default?

Interestingly, the same logic appears at different levels.
States conceal information — and call it protection.
Individuals hide things — and experience it as self-protection.

The pattern is the same, only the scale changes.

Systems tend to reward concealment.
Those who reveal less take fewer risks.
Those who stay silent more skilfully remain safe.
And after a while, we stop asking whether this is actually healthy.

The real question isn’t whether protection is needed.
It’s what we’re protecting ourselves from.

A stable system doesn’t need to hide everything in order to survive.
It can tolerate visibility,
because it isn’t built on a lack of information,
but on the quality of how it functions.

At that point, another question inevitably emerges:
what if security didn’t come from money,
from position,
or from accumulation…

…but from visible contribution?
From what we genuinely add to one another,
to communities,
to systems.

Perhaps transparency itself isn’t dangerous.
Perhaps it’s only fragile systems that can’t withstand it.
