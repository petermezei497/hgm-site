Today was objectively fine.
Tasks completed. No conflicts. No rushing.
Everything one might expect from a "good day."
Yet I ended it with a bitter taste I couldn't explain.


The realisation came only when I got home:
It wasn't the day.
It wasn't the work.
It was the pain.

My back has been hurting for days — not dramatically, just constantly. And it reminded me: my ankle has been doing this for nearly 25 years.

I've learned that chronic pain doesn't just hurt. It drains. It creates background tension that quietly rewrites how we experience otherwise neutral events.

There were times when I'd come home and immediately have to sleep — not from tiredness, but to avoid snapping at anyone who spoke to me.

Not because I'm an aggressive person.
Because my nervous system was under sustained load.


This got me thinking:
How often do we misread "system load" as lack of motivation?
When performance feels off, our instinct is to look at:
- attitude
- engagement
- resilience
- mindset

But sometimes the issue isn't psychological at all.
Low-level, persistent physical discomfort — even when it isn’t dramatic — quietly reduces available capacity:
- less cognitive bandwidth
- lower tolerance
- reduced emotional regulation

Not because of character.
Not because of effort.

Because part of the system's resources are permanently allocated to coping.


If we don't recognise this pattern, we misread performance — in ourselves, in colleagues, in teams.
We attribute to motivation what is actually capacity.
We judge as attitude what is actually system constraint.
Sometimes nothing is wrong with the person.
Sometimes nothing is wrong with the work.
The system is simply operating closer to its limits than we realise.


This isn't about making excuses.
It's about accurate diagnosis.

What we call "underperformance" isn't always a mindset issue.
Sometimes it deserves attention and compassion, not judgement. ❤️
