Lately, I’ve realised something.

I’m not waiting for people to *“wake up.”*  
I’m waiting for their **normal self**  
to finally have **room to breathe**.

I don’t believe people are inherently lazy, broken, or uninterested.  
I think they’re **overwhelmed**.  
Pulled apart.  
Disconnected from themselves.

And when someone is finally given a bit of space —  
not pressure,  
not motivation,  
not expectations —  
but **presence**…

something very different happens.

**The human shows up.**  
Not aggressive.  
Not defensive.  
But **curious. Connected. Alive.**

Maybe we don’t need *new* people.  
Maybe we need a world  
where the existing ones can be **well**.

We don’t need to be faster.  
We need to be **freer**. ❤️
