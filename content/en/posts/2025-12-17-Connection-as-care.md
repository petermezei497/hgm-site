Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about **how isolated we tend to become when we’re ill**.

Almost automatically, many of us fall into the belief:  
*“This is my problem. I need to deal with it on my own.”*

But if we take a small step back, something else becomes visible.

In reality, we are all part of communities —  
**families, neighbourhoods, cities, countries, and ultimately a shared world**.  
And every community is strongest when its members are well.

Illness is never purely an individual matter.

It affects **everyone who is connected to us**.

Maybe that’s why difficult periods feel even heavier when they are paired with isolation.  
Not only because of the pain itself —  
but because we lose what could make it **more bearable**.

Connection doesn’t always heal.  
But very often, it makes what’s heavy **easier to carry**.

And perhaps we only need to accept what is truly unchangeable —  
not what **fear makes appear larger than it really is**.

In recent years, we’ve seen how powerful the combination of fear and isolation can be.  
Especially when the intention to protect becomes disconnected from **human connection**.

At the same time, I’ve long been inspired by community patterns —  
sometimes from distant cultures —  
where hardship is met not with exclusion, but with **holding**.

Where the community doesn’t turn away,  
but **gathers around those who are weaker**.

This may not work in every situation.  
But the question still matters:

**What heals more in the long run — isolation or connection?**

For me, the Human Growth Model is also about this.  
Not about ready-made solutions, but about **direction**.

About recognising that humans were not designed  
for isolated survival —  
nor for isolated flourishing.

And that perhaps what we need is not to become tougher —  
but **more connected**. ❤️
