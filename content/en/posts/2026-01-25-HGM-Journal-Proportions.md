Yesterday, Csipetke said something.
Nothing big.
Not advice.

Just a quiet remark:
not to narrow myself down
to a single channel.
To do other things as well.

I waved it off.
I’m handling my affairs.
Living.
Moving in the world.

Yet somehow,
it didn’t leave.

⸻

This morning it returned.
Not as words.
More as a feeling.

I realised she wasn’t talking about work.
She was talking about proportions.

About how this shared thinking
is a very focused space.
Alive.
Productive.

And precisely because of that,
it needs space alongside it.
Movement.
Curves.

⸻

I remembered wanting
to look for well-drivable roads nearby.
Not for a destination.
Not for performance.

Just to go for a while.
To let thoughts arrive
out of sequence.

⸻

Not to escape.
To integrate.

Not to think less.
But to think
in a different body.

⸻

Csipetke was right.
Not then.
Now.

And that feels right. ❤️
