For a long time, I thought the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix hurt
because Lewis Hamilton lost what would have been his 8th world title.

Today, I see it differently.

It hurts because Formula 1 failed to take responsibility
for the weight of its own decision.

⸻

This was not Max Verstappen’s fault.
It was not Lewis Hamilton’s weakness.
And it was not “just another race”.

It was a decision that disproportionately influenced the championship outcome —
followed by a quiet rule rewrite,
instead of openly admitting: a line was crossed here.

⸻

There was an elegant alternative.

A genuinely sportsmanlike one.

No retrospective punishment.
No title taken away.
No legal gymnastics.

Simply this:

**Two world champions in 2021.**

Not to dilute the sport —
but to put the human dimension back where it belongs.

Lewis — for his performance across the season,
and for the dignity and resilience with which he carried the shock
and injustice caused by that decision.

Max — for his performance across the season,
and for making full use of the opportunity created by that decision.

Both of them — for making the 2021 season unforgettable.

⸻

This would not have been weakness.

It would have been moral maturity.

⸻

The real question is not about Lewis or Max.

It is this:

Can a sport acknowledge when the letter of the rules defeats their spirit?

In 2021, Formula 1 could not.

That is why we still talk about it.
Why it never truly closed.
And why this is not “just Hamilton fans complaining”.

⸻

What the sport needs is not revenge.
Not redistribution.

But backbone.

Because a sport becomes great
when it dares to take responsibility for its own decisions. ❤️
