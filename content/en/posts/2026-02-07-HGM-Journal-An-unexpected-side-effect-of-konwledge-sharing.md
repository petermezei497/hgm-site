I was genuinely pleased.

We’d found the optimal settings for the solar-battery system:
maximum financial efficiency,
whilst preserving battery lifespan.

It felt good.
Not “maxed out”, not “pushed to the limit”,
but intelligently fine-tuned.

Once we had that, sharing it felt natural.
First, just the experience.

Then it occurred to me that it might concretely benefit someone else.

And that’s when something small, but important, happened.

I thought I’d pass on not just the result,
but the thought process as well.

How we got there.
What we paid attention to.
What we deliberately didn’t choose — and why.

And before sending it,
I double-checked what the system was actually doing.

I knew the app had introduced a new percentage-based logic.
I didn’t suspect anything — I just wanted to be certain.

And that’s where it fell apart.

The graph looked “nice”.
The numbers seemed fine at first glance.

But after having a closer look,
they reflected a completely different scenario.

We were importing expensively during peak hours.
Meanwhile, the battery sat there, with available energy.

If I hadn’t wanted to pass on the thinking,
if I’d just kept using it quietly,
I probably would have noticed much later.

That’s stayed with me since.

Sharing isn’t just kindness.
It’s not just a community gesture.

It’s a ruthless check.

What you can’t explain clearly
usually doesn’t work the way you think it does.

Ironically, it was wanting to help someone else
that protected my own system.

I didn’t become quicker.
I didn’t become tougher.

Just a little more aware.
And perhaps a little freer, too. ❤️
