There’s a small moment from recently that hasn’t really left me.

It was a misunderstood remark.
Something meant as a joke, landing the wrong way.
For a brief moment, the space tightened.

Then someone tossed it back into play:
“So why is it okay for you?”

It turned into laughter.
Not because we “resolved” anything —
but because the tension disappeared.

And only afterwards did I realise why that mattered.

It wasn’t about figuring out who was right.
We didn’t carefully unpack intentions or clarify every angle.
We simply found our way back to a place where play was possible again.

Later, I caught myself phrasing it like this:
“We notice a disturbance in the field, we talk it through, and it dissolves.”

Not as a method.
Not as a technique.
But as a way of functioning.

That’s where it became interesting.

Because in adult settings, this is surprisingly rare.
At work.
In serious conversations.
In places where everything quickly feels like it’s “at stake”.

A joke starts to sound like a threat.
Irony feels like an attack.
Playfulness gets mistaken for irresponsibility.

But it isn’t.

Playfulness isn’t childishness.
It’s the ability to stay in motion when tension appears.
To not harden around being right.
To care less about winning — and more about keeping the connection alive.

And somewhere along the way, I feel many adults didn’t become more mature.
They just lost this ability.

The ability to return to play.
To that space where you don’t have to win —
you just have to be present.

Maybe this doesn’t need fixing.
Maybe it just needs remembering.

That this once came naturally.
And perhaps, it still could. ❤️
