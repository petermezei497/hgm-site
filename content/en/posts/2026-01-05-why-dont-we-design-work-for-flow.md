title: "Why don’t we design work for flow?"

Today I found myself wondering why driving can’t be an experience.

Not racing.  
Not speeding.  
But presence.

Why do we design roads as if humans were a flaw in the system?  
As if joy were dangerous.  
As if attention could only be maintained through restriction.

And yet, when a person enters flow — even while driving —  
they don’t fall apart.  
They come together.

They don’t become aggressive.  
They become present.

They’re not escaping.  
They’re there.

Lately, I’ve noticed something in myself:

When there is an activity that genuinely nourishes me  
(right now, that’s thinking, writing, and the Human Growth Model),  
other parts of my life that don’t serve me  
don’t disappear through struggle —  
they simply fall away.

Maybe what we need isn’t more motivation.  
Maybe not more rules.

Maybe we need systems that allow people to be well.

We don’t need to be faster.  
We need to be *freer*. ❤️
