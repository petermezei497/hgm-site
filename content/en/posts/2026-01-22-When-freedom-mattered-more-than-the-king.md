Today I came across a text from 1320.<br>
It’s called the Declaration of Arbroath. <br>  
And I paused for a moment.

Not because it’s old.<br>
But because it felt **unexpectedly familiar**.

---

In it, a community explains<br>
why it keeps its leader.

And also<br>
when it would not.

---

Not bloodline.<br>
Not rank.<br>
Not “this is how it’s always been”.

But one single condition:

**as long as he serves shared freedom.**

---

And if he doesn’t?<br>
Then he is replaced.<br>
Calmly.<br>
Self-evidently.

Not as rebellion.<br>
Not as betrayal.<br>
But as function.

---

That struck me.

Because today, we often think the other way around.

The system stays.<br>
The person adapts.

The structure is sacred.<br>
The tension is an “individual problem”.

---

Back then, it seems,<br>
there was a quiet agreement:

Power is **not the goal**.<br>
The leader is **not untouchable**.<br>
Freedom is **not an individual project**.

---

Freedom was a shared space.<br>
Not a slogan.<br>
Not an identity.<br>
But a condition.

---

And as I read this,<br>
a very familiar feeling surfaced:

As if the Human Growth Model<br>
wasn’t a new idea at all.

But a **remembering**.

---

A remembering that systems only live<br>
as long as it is good for people to live in them.

And that once,<br>
we understood this with great precision.

---

I’m not writing this as a lesson.<br>
More as a question.

What do we treat as untouchable today,<br>
when in fact it only needs to be operated?

And what might we have replaced long ago<br>
— quietly, humanly?
