The more I work on the Human Growth Model (HGM),  
the clearer one thing becomes:

**Humour and play are not “extras”** —  
they are the *deepest*, *fastest*, most *human* ways of learning.

And yet, most organisations still hold on to an old belief:

Work must be serious.  
Learning must be serious.  
Humour is risky.  
Play is unprofessional.

But here’s the paradox.

Play creates **focus**.  
Humour increases **learning retention by 400–500%**.  
Laughter reduces **stress** and opens the mind.  

People learn faster, connect more deeply,  
and collaborate better.

So why aren’t we using it?

Because humour **dissolves hierarchy**.  
It builds **connection**.  
It exposes the **absurd**.  
It creates **psychological safety**.

And old corporate systems were never designed for that.

But the new ones are.

Today, some of the most progressive organisations are already showing what’s possible:

- Duolingo — playful learning as a global standard
- LEGO Group — creativity as a way of working
- Spotify — human onboarding and playful rituals
- Air New Zealand — the world’s most entertaining safety training
- Atlassian — culture designed for openness
- Coffee Stain Studios (Goat Simulator) — humour as a genuine teaching tool

These examples point to something simple — and profound:

If you want people to truly learn,  
don’t make it heavier.

Make it **lighter**.  
Make it **playful**.  
Make it **human**.

And maybe this is where HGM really begins.

Not with  
364 days of adult seriousness  
and one day of “team-building fun”.

But with  
**364 days of childlike presence, curiosity and creativity** —  
and perhaps one brief day of adulting,  
when absolutely necessary.

Because the child-self in all of us still learns the same way:

Curiosity.  
Humour.  
Connection.  
Play.

If you’re building or experimenting with humour-driven or play-based learning,  
I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

This is where **culture**, **wellbeing** and **performance** finally meet. ❤️
