This series is not economic history.
It's an observation of how systems treat people.

⸻

**1) What did it respond to?**

Early capitalism responded to feudal rigidity.
To fixed roles,
birth-defined life paths,
and frozen social structures.

It promised space
where there had only been position.

⸻

**2) What did it reward?**

Enterprise.
Risk-taking.
Movement and adaptability.

If you were willing to step out of place
and carry uncertainty,
opportunity appeared.

⸻

**3) What did it punish?**

Stagnation.
Slowness.
Those who could not adapt.

The system was open —
but only to those
who could keep up.

⸻

**4) How did it handle risk?**

Risk shifted downward.

Where feudalism offered top-down protection,
early capitalism relocated uncertainty
to the individual.

Merchants, entrepreneurs, workers
operated at their own risk.

In return, there was a promise:
mobility.

⸻

**5) What happened to money when it "worked"?**

Money became a tool.

A medium for exchange,
movement and growth.

When it worked,
it circulated.
It kept the system in motion.

⸻

**6) What was its corrective effect — and for how long?**

It loosened rigid structures.
Opened real paths of movement.
Created exits from fixed roles.

But over time,
movement became obligation,
and human safety faded from view.

⸻

**Early warning signals**

**1. Hardening:**
When opportunity turns into obligation,
and movement becomes expected.

**2. Risk-shifting:**
When uncertainty fully transfers
onto the individual.

**3. Money distortion:**
When money stops being a tool
and becomes a goal —
accumulation, optimisation, profit logic
even where human space should remain.

⸻

**How people lived in the system**

**...when it worked (Flow):**

Movement. Possibility. Experimentation.
Exit from birth-assigned destiny.

Life was no longer predetermined.
There was room to try.

**...when it began to harden (Friction):**

Constant proving.
Permanent risk.
No safety net.

If you didn't move quickly enough,
you could fall out.

**...in general:**

More liveable than feudal rigidity.
But not liveable enough to last.

⸻

We don't have to be quicker.
We don't have to be tougher.
We need to be freer. ❤️
