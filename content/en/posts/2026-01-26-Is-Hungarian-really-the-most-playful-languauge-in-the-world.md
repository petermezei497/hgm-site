This question came up while I was watching a YouTube video where language prodigies were talking.
They were trying to figure out whether Estonian, Finnish, or Hungarian is harder to learn.

My first, instinctive reaction was:

Careful — that’s not easy to state objectively.

If we compare languages, Hungarian is clearly in a very strong field.
But the idea of “the most” always depends on what we are measuring:
- the structure of the rules?
- creative freedom?
- possibilities for wordplay?
- or how well a language tolerates being played with?

And then the ace card appeared.

Eszperente.

A Hungarian constraint-based language game.
Not a joke.
Not a poetic trick.
A strict, self-imposed constraint:
- only e / é vowels (advanced level: only e 😏),
- and still meaningful, fluent, living language.

Many languages would collapse under this.
Hungarian doesn’t — it adapts.

That was the moment my answer shifted.

Because a language is not playful because it is easy.
It is playful because it invites play,
and because it doesn’t punish you for playing — 
it simply takes you somewhere else.

Eszperente doesn’t break Hungarian.
Quite the opposite:
it reveals how flexible, creative, and alive it really is.

And when a language can handle this collectively —
when people speak it, correct each other, and laugh together —
then perhaps it’s not an exaggeration to say:

It may not be mathematically provable.
But Hungarian is certainly one of the most play-born languages in the world.

And now, the evidence.

Eszperente (original)

E nyelv nem merev, e nyelv nem feszes,
E rendszer nem reped, ebben eszes.
Ezt tesz erre. Emezt meg emerre,
De ezen terhek nem lesz semerre.
Nyelve meg: keretben leled meg
e teremtett, szellemes rendet. ❤️

English translation

This language is not rigid, this language is not tight,
This system does not crack — it is clever inside.
This goes here, that moves elsewhere,
Yet these burdens lead nowhere.
Its tongue reveals, within a frame,
A crafted order — playful, sane.
