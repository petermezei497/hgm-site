An elderly man was taken to the emergency department.

Over the course of the night, the entire right side of his body froze.  
So severely that doctors said  
his hand may need to be amputated.

This didn’t happen because help wasn’t available.  
It happened because he didn’t ask for it.

Today, people would rather suffer —  
even die —  
than ask for help.

And this isn’t an individual tragedy.  
It’s a systemic outcome.

---

The way our systems currently function conditions us  
to solve everything alone.

To believe that problems are shameful.  
That asking for help is weakness.  
That safety is a private matter.

Yet historically, it was the opposite.  
When trouble came, the community stepped in.  
Not only afterwards —  
often before things escalated.

---

So what do we see today instead?

An economic and social system where  
extraction  
and profit maximisation  
have become the primary measures of “success”.

And here’s the uncomfortable part:

Organisations and leaders who genuinely take care of their people  
often produce *worse numbers*.

On paper.

---

In reality, these organisations tend to be:

- more stable
- operating with fewer hidden costs
- experiencing less burnout
- facing less passive resistance
- maintaining healthier atmospheres
- achieving higher *real* productivity

They’re simply not considered “successful” by today’s metrics.

---

The selfishness we observe isn’t a moral failure.  
It’s adaptive behaviour.

In an environment where survival is an individual project  
and community is treated as a cost,  
people cling —  
or sink.

---

The Human Growth Model doesn’t propose a new ideology.

It asks a different question:

What if success wasn’t measured by how much you extracted —  
but by what you left functioning behind?

- Did the collective become more capable?
- Did safety increase?
- Did collaboration become easier?
- Did people grow stronger — not more depleted?

---

What often *doesn’t look successful today*  
is actually sustainable.

What looks successful now  
frequently burns out fast.

And perhaps the issue isn’t people.

Perhaps it’s the metric.
