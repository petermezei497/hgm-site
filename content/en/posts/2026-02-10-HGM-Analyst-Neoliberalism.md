This series is not economic history.
It's an observation of how systems treat people.

⸻

What did it respond to?

Neoliberalism responded to the crisis of the welfare state.
To overburdened budgets,
slowing growth,
intensifying global competition.

To the realisation that previous promises
no longer fit unchanged
into a transformed economic environment.

It promised efficiency
where previously there had been security.

⸻

What did it reward?

Competitiveness.
Flexibility.
Self-reliance.

Those who adapted quickly,
who could manage themselves,
who took on risk,
gained advantage.

The individual became the project.

⸻

What did it punish?

Slowness.
Dependence.
Vulnerability.

Those who couldn't keep pace,
who became vulnerable,
gradually became invisible.

The system wasn't hostile.
Just indifferent.

⸻

How did it handle risk?

It individualised risk.
What had previously been collective responsibility
(illness, unemployment, livelihood)
increasingly became personal risk.

The price of freedom became
everyone being responsible for themselves.

⸻

What happened to money when it "worked"?

Money became the measure.
Everything turned into numbers.
What increased it became "good".
What couldn't be measured "didn't count".

It simplified comparison,
accelerated decisions,
and reduced collective costs.

⸻

What was its corrective effect — and for how long?

It temporarily increased efficiency.
It reduced collective costs.
It accelerated systems.

Those things that couldn't be measured in money
were pushed into the background —
or became completely invisible:
- physical health,
- mental state,
- time spent together,
- relationships, communities.

Money was no longer a tool,
but the ultimate feedback on
whether a person "had value",
or a goal that constantly shifts,
of which there's never enough.
What it gained in the short term,
it lost in the long term.

⸻

Early warning signals

Hardening:
When people become replaceable,
and personal stories no longer matter.

Risk-shifting:
When the system remains stable,
but the individual becomes increasingly fragile.

Money distortion:
When the measure of efficiency
becomes more important than human cost.
When productivity overrides everything else.

⸻

How people lived in the system…

...when it worked (Flow):
Freedom. Choice. Mobility.
The feeling that "it's up to me".

...when it began to harden (Friction):
Constant proving.
Constant adaptation.
Constant readiness.

Security became a privilege.
Uncertainty became the default state.

...in general:
More liveable than overspending systems,
but not liveable enough to last.

⸻

We don't have to be quicker.
We don't have to be tougher.
We need systems
that are sustainable
by people, for people —
but NEVER at the cost of human life. ❤️
