Not because people would be lazy.
But because there’d be nothing to run from.

Most of today’s speed isn’t driven by ambition.
It’s driven by internal pressure:
– proving
– performing
– not falling behind

When mental wellbeing becomes the baseline,
that mode simply stops activating.

If it’s good where you are,
you don’t need to escape elsewhere.

Travel stops being avoidance
and becomes curiosity.
Work stops being pressure
and becomes creation.
Performance stops being the goal
and turns into a side effect.

Here’s the paradox:

A slower rhythm would produce more real value.

Less noise.
Less urgency theatre.
More presence.

Not hustle.
Flow.

We don’t need to become faster.
Or tougher.
Just freer. ❤️
