Somehow, everything connected.

I walked into a disagreement with a friend.
He brought up the “witch-hunting” parallel.
I didn’t react immediately. I just said that, to me, it looked like a classic pattern of enemy-making:
“I’ll protect you from the enemy” — only back then, with far more brutal tools.
Same mechanism as today.
We paused. A shared silence.

Then he explained the logic behind his view.
I listened.
He had to rush, so we didn’t close it — I just said: we’ll come back to this.
And that felt right.

I connected with my car too.

The steering felt oddly heavy at first — then it clicked: for the last two days I’d been driving a new car with ultra-light steering.
Once I realised that, driving suddenly became an experience again.
And the sound system helped. 😄

The mechanic was covered in oil from head to toe.
Told me he was completely overloaded, booked solid, but he’d check the car and call me.

I asked his name.
I pronounced it wrong.
We laughed.

That was enough.

I stepped outside to call a taxi.

A random guy was walking to his car.
Slightly awkward “alright”-exchange.
I mentioned I’d dropped my car off for an MOT.

Suddenly we were talking about Pat.
Good mechanic. Always overloaded.
Who would’ve guessed. 🙂

The taxi driver’s name was Qasir.

I didn’t just read it — I asked how to pronounce it.
Then where the name comes from.

Pakistan. Capital city. Too many people.
I said: maybe not too many people — just too little (or broken) infrastructure.
He nodded.

Religion came up.
I asked whether he feels like money has become the new super-god.

He agreed instantly.

I thanked him for the conversation.
£2 tip in the app.

Did I just pay for a good feeling?

Yes.
And every penny was worth it.

In between: phone calls.
Witnessing documents. Deadlines.
Jokes about “hyper-dirty paperwork”.

Everything felt light.

The key was the same in every situation:
**PLAYFULNESS**.
(You don’t like being shouted at either, right? 😉)

That’s why it energises me.

I love this. ❤️
