*(how this blog was built — not technically, but humanly)*

Let’s start with **why**, not **how**.

I didn’t want a blog.  
I wanted a place  
where thoughts don’t disappear into a feed.

Something durable.  
A space of my own.  
Not driven by algorithms.

---

So we began with  
what this blog **does not want**.

It doesn’t want to demand attention.  
It doesn’t want to decide for you.  
It doesn’t want to be “smarter” than you.

It doesn’t use geo-IP based language detection.  
Not because it couldn’t.  
But because we consciously chose  
to respect everyone’s privacy.

If you want to read in Hungarian, you switch.  
If English works for you, you stay.  
That’s it.

---

The blog is deliberately minimal.

No images.  
No visual noise.  
No clutter.

Kindle-like.  
Black on white / white on black.

Partly for accessibility — including colour-blind readers.  
Partly as intentional visual noise reduction.  
This is how I like to read.

The text stays.  
The thought stays.  
Everything else quietens down.

There was a point where I could have lived quite happily  
with an *En / Hu* language switcher.

Technically, it was fine.  
It worked.

I had almost accepted it.  
Almost let it go.

Then something in me said:  
“Alright — one last attempt.”

I did the work.  
And thankfully, it paid off.

When I told my AI companion about it,  
it helped me see what was really happening.

This wasn’t a cosmetic change.  
It was about making the site  
more human, more comfortable.

A small thing.  
Yet somehow, everything fell into place.

---

People often say most of the time  
goes into the “big things”.

That was true for me as well.

The big things — the posts, the Human Growth Model itself —  
took most of the time.

Building the blog took far less.

And yet:  
within the blog work,  
the hardest parts were the ones  
I was closest to abandoning.

The fine-tuning.  
The things we could have launched without.

Not because they took long.  
But because that time was spent  
at a lower energy frequency.

Perhaps what matters isn’t always  
how much time you put into something,  
but **the state you’re in while doing it**.

If you read this, thank you.  
If you share it, that’s fine too.  
If you simply pause with it for a few minutes — it was worth it.

This is how the Human Growth Model blog was born. ❤️
